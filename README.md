## My process

My process for developing this Amazon Clone involved several key steps:

- Planning: I started by analyzing Amazon's website and creating a plan for the project. I identified the key features to implement and outlined the project's structure.

- Responsive Design: I ensured that the website is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.

- Testing: I thoroughly tested the component on different browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.

- HTML & CSS: I implemented the card's structure using semantic HTML and styled it using CSS, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
  
- Deployment: I deployed the frontend to a hosting platform like AWS, Netlify, or Vercel to make the website accessible online.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS for custom properties
- Flexbox in CSS

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in frontend development and learned:

- Responsive web design techniques.
- The Use of Semantic Tag which makes the website professional.
- Uses of Flexbox which makes easier to build the different sections.
- How to create reusable and customizable components.
- Best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by:

- Enhance the user interface and add more features.
- Implementing animations and transitions for a more engaging user experience.
- Optimize performance for a smoother user experience.
- Implement additional user authentication methods (e.g., OAuth).
- Add product search and filtering functionality.
- Implementing Advanced React concepts, including hooks and context API.
- How to integrate a frontend with a backend API.
- State management using Redux for complex applications.
